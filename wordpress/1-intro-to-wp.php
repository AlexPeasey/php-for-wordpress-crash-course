 * 1. Move WP install back in place, make sure it's loading.
 * 2. Explore the wp-content folder: this is what can be edited (we'll explore the other folders later).
 * 3. Themes for presentation, plugins for functionality (definitely a gray area).
 * 4. Get the twentytwenty and twentytwentytwo themes installed, activate twentytwenty.
 * 5. We will edit the functions.php file mostly, but other files as well, but you shouldn't do this on a real site (we'll cover that in the next course).
 * 6. Import some data with the Theme Unit Test: https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test (in this directory).
